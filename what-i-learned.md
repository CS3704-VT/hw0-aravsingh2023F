## What I learned from HW0
Before reading HW0, I was only able to pull, push, and fork on Git through the command line. 
Now, it seems much easier for me to do these tasks in the GitHub online platform.
This is the case for md files, but I still want to gain more experience with editing on the GitHub platform with actual code files.
